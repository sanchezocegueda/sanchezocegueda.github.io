    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      I used to study EECS and Mathematics at UC Berkeley. 
      Now I just go wherever life takes me.
      My main research interests are formal methods and graph theory.

      I also enjoy playing the guitar, reading, and writing.

    <h2>Learning</h2>
    <p>I have learned to value self-learning more and more over time.
      Reading math textbooks and trying to solve them has become somewhat of a hobby of mine.
      Below is a list of the textbooks I have worked on/am working on currently.
