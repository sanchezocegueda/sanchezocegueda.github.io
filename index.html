    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a math enthusiast.
      In my opinion, there is no better way to exercise one's ability to think clearly than to attempt a challenging proof.

      Aside from math, I also enjoy playing the reading, writing, and playing the guitar.

    <h2>Learning</h2>
    <p>I have learned to value self-learning more and more over time.
      Reading math textbooks and trying to solve them has become a hobby of mine.
      Below is a list of the textbooks I have worked on.
