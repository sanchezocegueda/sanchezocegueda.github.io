  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>
    I am a young scientist hailing from Mexico City, Mexico. 
    Currently, I am a rising senior at UC Berkeley, where I study Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, and Mathematics.
    As of 2023, my main interest, by far, is cybersecurity.
    Specifically, I find the intersection of applied formal methods and hardware security to be nothing short of fascinating.
    On the less technical side, I strive to bring cybersecurity awareness and education to the general public.
    My goal in life is to live in a world where cyberattacks are no longer a threat to anyone.

  <p>
    As for the more human side of me, I enjoy playing the guitar, reading, and writing.
    I am also a video game enthusiast, and I spend many of my non-work hours practicing to compete in Super Smash Bros. Melee tournaments.
